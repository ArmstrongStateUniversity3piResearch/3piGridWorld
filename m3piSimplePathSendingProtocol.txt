Armstrong Robotics m3pi Simple Path Sending Protocol

Send through serial:
'[NAME OF ROBOT EXPRESSED AS A SINGLE CHARACTER][ENTIRE PATH WRITTEN AS A SERIES OF X AND Y COORDINATES]fg'

NOTE: Robot names must NOT be the characters 'f' or 'g'
NOTE: 'f' finishes a path for each individual robot, 'g' tells ALL robots to go
NOTE: Send and many paths as necessary to as many robots as necessary by starting the path with
the roobot's name, writing the path without spaces, and concluding the path with the character 'f'

EXAMPLES:

Given a robot with some name, 'p'
Given a path, (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Send the following message through serial:
p112233fg

Given two robots with names, 'p' and 'q'
Given a path, (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3) for 'p'
Given a path, (0, 0), (0, 5), (5, 5) for 'q'
